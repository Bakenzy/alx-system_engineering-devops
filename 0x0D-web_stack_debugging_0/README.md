WEB STACK DEBUGGING 0
Almost all the time our web servers never go as expected Whether its a missing semi-colon ðŸ˜† or faulty packages something is boud to go wrong. In the worst case scenario, it's not even your original code base you're jumping in from someone else and you see a lot of messy stuff. Well that's what this repo is about,building debugging skills. We are given a faulty container and it's our job to run it and get it right. Ths nginx here is faulty and is not returning a page when a request is sent to it. IN my answer file here 0-give_me_a_page you will see the steps I took to find the problem and fix it.
